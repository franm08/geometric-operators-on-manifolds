# Geometric Operators on Manifolds

This repository contains the code and generated figures for the project **Geometric Operators on Manifolds**, which studies motion and orientation using differential geometry and rotation theory.

The goal of the project is to make the mathematics behind movement and rotation explicit, rather than treating them as black-box operations commonly used in interactive and real-time systems.

## Overview

The project explores geometric operators that arise naturally when modeling movement and orientation on curved surfaces and rotation spaces.

Key topics include:

- **ShortestCurve**  
  Geodesics on surfaces (plane, sphere, and terrain)

- **CarryNoTwist**  
  Parallel transport of orientation using covariant derivatives

- **Rotation and Gimbal Lock**  
  Limitations of Euler angles and axis-aligned rotation matrices

- **Quaternions**  
  Quaternion algebra, unit quaternions, and rotation representation

- **Exponential and Logarithm Maps**  
  Mapping between \( \mathbb{R}^3 \) and \( S^3 \)

## Figures

- Computational figures were generated using custom Python scripts included in this repository.
- Some conceptual figures were generated or refined using AI tools (ChatGPT or Gemini) and are labeled accordingly in the paper.

Figures generated using code from this repository are cited in the paper as:

## Notes

This repository is intended to accompany the written paper and presentation slides.  
The code focuses on figure generation and mathematical visualization rather than production-level implementations.
